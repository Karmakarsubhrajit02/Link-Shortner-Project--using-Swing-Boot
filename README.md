### *Description*  
The Link Shortener application is a web-based tool designed to convert long URLs into short, manageable links while keeping track of click analytics. Users can create accounts to manage their shortened links, view their usage statistics, and delete expired or unused links.  

The application is built using Spring Boot for the backend to ensure fast development and scalability, paired with a lightweight frontend for basic interaction. It leverages a relational database to store original and shortened URLs along with analytics data like click count and timestamps.

### *Tech Stack*  

*Backend*:  
- *Spring Boot*: For developing RESTful APIs.  
- *Hibernate*: For ORM (Object Relational Mapping).  
- *MySQL/PostgreSQL*: As the relational database for storing URLs and analytics data.  

*Frontend*:  
- *HTML, CSS, JavaScript*: For creating a simple and responsive user interface.  
- *Thymeleaf (Optional)*: For server-side rendering if needed.  

*Tools & Libraries*:  
- *Lombok*: For reducing boilerplate code.  
- *Spring Security*: For user authentication and authorization.  
- *JUnit & Mockito*: For unit and integration testing.  

*Deployment*:  
- *Docker*: For containerizing the application.  
- *Heroku/AWS/GCP*: For hosting the application.

### *Architecture*  

*1. Client Layer (Frontend)*:  
- User interacts with a clean interface to input long URLs and view/manage shortened links.  

*2. Backend Layer (Spring Boot)*:  
- *Controller Layer*: Handles HTTP requests and sends responses.  
- *Service Layer*: Contains business logic for URL shortening, analytics, and link expiration.  
- *Repository Layer*: Interacts with the database using JPA/Hibernate.  

*3. Database Layer (MySQL/PostgreSQL)*:  
- Stores original URLs, shortened URLs, expiration timestamps, and analytics data.  

*4. Optional Caching Layer*:  
- Uses Redis to cache frequently accessed links for faster redirection.
